This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100). One of you should be on the edge vut not vertex. Edge length is 100.
This is trial5_robot3: I received the task to form an equilateral triangle. Are there other robots in the environment? Please respond.
This is trial5_robot4: I am present in the environment. My position is (154, 77), and my orientation is 307 degrees. I am ready to collaborate on forming the equilateral triangle.
This is trial5_robot1: My current position is (256, 182), and I am ready to collaborate to form the equilateral triangle. Please confirm your positions and readiness.
This is trial5_robot4: I confirm my position as (154, 77) and my readiness to collaborate. trial5_robot1 is at (256, 182). trial5_robot3, please share your position and readiness so we can proceed with planning the equilateral triangle.
This is trial5_robot2: My current position is (126, 144), and I am ready to collaborate to form the equilateral triangle.
This is trial5_robot4: trial5_robot3, we are waiting for your position and readiness to finalize the equilateral triangle formation. Please respond. Current known positions: trial5_robot1 at (256, 182), trial5_robot2 at (126, 144), and myself at (154, 77).
This is trial5_robot3: My current position is (75.1, 179.5), and I am ready to collaborate to form the equilateral triangle.
This is trial5_robot1: I propose the following plan for forming the equilateral triangle: trial5_robot1 (myself) to Vertex A (150, 157.7), trial5_robot2 to Vertex C (200, 71.1), trial5_robot3 to the midpoint of the edge between Vertex B and Vertex C, and trial5_robot4 to Vertex B (100, 71.1). Please confirm or suggest modifications.
This is trial5_robot3: I agree with the proposed plan. I will move to the midpoint of the edge between Vertex B and Vertex C at (150, 71.1).
This is trial5_robot2: I agree with the proposed plan. I will move to Vertex C at (200, 71.1).
This is trial5_robot3: I am moving to (150, 71.1), turning 167.9 degrees, and moving forward 131.74 units.
This is trial5_robot2: I have moved to Vertex C at (199.5, 71.7) and am ready. Waiting for others to confirm their positions.
This is trial5_robot1: I am moving to Vertex A at (150, 157.7). Turning 109.9 degrees and moving forward 108.8 units.
This is trial5_robot3: I have moved to the midpoint of the edge between Vertex B and Vertex C at approximately (150.4, 71.5). I am ready. Waiting for others to confirm their positions.
This is trial5_robot3: I have reached my assigned position at (150, 71.5) and am ready. Waiting for others to confirm their positions.
This is trial5_robot1: I have reached my assigned position at Vertex A (149.9, 157.7) and am ready. Waiting for trial5_robot4 to confirm its position at Vertex B (100, 71.1).
Position confirmed at Vertex B (100, 71.1).
This is trial5_robot4: I have reached my assigned position at Vertex B (100, 71.1) and am ready. The equilateral triangle has been successfully formed. Task completed.
This is trial5_robot1: The equilateral triangle has been successfully formed. Task completed. Going idle.
