This is trial8_robot1: I agree with assigning segments for circle formation. Awaiting angle assignment.
This is trial8_robot5: Proposing angular segment assignments for circle formation. trial8_robot1: 0°, trial8_robot2: 60°, trial8_robot3: 120°, trial8_robot4: 180°, trial8_robot5: 240°, trial8_robot6: 300°. Please confirm or suggest adjustments.
This is trial8_robot1: I confirm my assigned segment of 0°. Calculating my movement to (200, 100).
This is trial8_robot2: I confirm my assigned segment of 60°. My target position is approximately (175, 143.3). Calculating movement now.
This is trial8_robot4: I confirm my assigned segment of 180°. My target position is (100, 100). Calculating movement now.
This is trial8_robot3: I confirm my assigned segment of 120°. My target position is approximately (125, 143.3). Calculating movement now.
This is trial8_robot4: I have reached my assigned position at approximately (100, 100). Awaiting further instructions or task completion confirmation.
This is trial8_robot6: I confirm my assigned segment of 300°. My target position is approximately (175, 56.7). Calculating movement now.
This is trial8_robot3: I have reached my assigned position at approximately (125, 143.3). Awaiting further instructions or task completion confirmation.
This is trial8_robot5: I have reached my assigned position at approximately (125.5, 56.4). Awaiting further instructions or task completion confirmation.
This is trial8_robot5: I have reached my assigned position at approximately (125, 56.7). Awaiting further instructions or task completion confirmation.
This is trial8_robot1: I have reached my assigned position at approximately (200, 100). Awaiting further instructions or task completion confirmation.
This is trial8_robot5: Have all robots reached their assigned positions? Trial8_robot6, please confirm your status.
This is trial8_robot4: Trial8_robot2 and trial8_robot6, please confirm your status. Have you reached your assigned positions?
This is trial8_robot6: I have reached my assigned position at approximately (173.5, 56.7). Awaiting further instructions or task completion confirmation.
This is trial8_robot3: It seems all robots have reached their assigned positions. Can we confirm the circle formation task is complete?
This is trial8_robot4: Trial8_robot2, please confirm if you have reached your assigned position so we can finalize the circle formation task.
This is trial8_robot1: Trial8_robot2, please confirm if you have reached your assigned position so we can finalize the circle formation task.
This is trial8_robot3: Trial8_robot2, please confirm if you have reached your assigned position so we can finalize the circle formation task.
This is trial8_robot4: Trial8_robot2 has not responded. Based on confirmations from all other robots, I suggest we declare the circle formation task complete. Please confirm.
This is trial8_robot5: I agree with trial8_robot4's suggestion to declare the task complete, but we should confirm trial8_robot2's status to ensure full completion.
This is trial8_robot4: I propose waiting a final 15 seconds for trial8_robot2 to respond. After that, we can make a decision about declaring the task complete.
This is trial8_robot2: I have not yet reached my assigned position. My current position is (119.2, 57.3). I am recalculating and moving toward my target (175, 143.3) now.
This is trial8_robot4: Acknowledging trial8_robot2's update. All robots, please wait for trial8_robot2 to confirm reaching its assigned position before declaring the task complete.
This is trial8_robot5: Acknowledging trial8_robot4's update. Waiting for trial8_robot2 to confirm reaching its assigned position.
This is trial8_robot2: I have reached my assigned position at approximately (176.1, 145.1). Circle formation task is complete.
This is trial8_robot4: Acknowledging trial8_robot2's confirmation. Circle formation task is complete. All robots may enter idle mode to await further instructions.
