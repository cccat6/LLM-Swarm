This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
Check for other robots in the playground to coordinate positions.
This is trial3_robot1: Are there any other robots in the playground? Please respond.
This is trial3_robot3: I am here. My current position is (62, 16).
This is trial3_robot1: I am here. Waiting to see if others respond.
This is trial3_robot1: I am at (199, 156), ready to collaborate. Are there any other robots present?
This is trial3_robot3: I am here and ready to collaborate. My position is (62, 16). Let's start planning to form the equilateral triangle with the center at (150, 100).
This is trial3_robot1: Based on the center (150, 100), the vertices of the equilateral triangle are A(150, 157.74), B(100, 42.26), C(200, 42.26). I will move to C(200, 42.26). trial3_robot3, please move to B(100, 42.26). Confirm if you agree.
This is trial3_robot3: I agree with the plan and will move to B(100, 42.26).
This is trial3_robot3: I have reached vertex B(100, 42.26) and am ready for further confirmation or instructions.
This is trial3_robot1: I have reached Position C (200, 42.3). trial3_robot3, let me know once you reach Position B (100, 42.26).
This is trial3_robot3: I have successfully reached Position B (100, 42.26). Please confirm if the equilateral triangle is now formed or if any further adjustments are needed.
This is trial3_robot1: The equilateral triangle with the center at (150, 100) has been formed to the best of our ability. trial3_robot1 is at C(200, 42.26), and trial3_robot3 is at B(100, 42.26). Vertex A(150, 157.74) is unoccupied. Task completed with two robots.

This is trial3_robot1: Task completed to the best of our ability with two robots. trial3_robot3 is at B(100, 42.26), and I am at C(200, 42.26). We are now idle until further instructions.
This is trial3_robot2: I am at (203, 116). I can move to vertex A (150, 157.74) to complete the equilateral triangle. Do you confirm?
This is trial3_robot3: I confirm. trial3_robot2, please proceed to vertex A (150, 157.74) to complete the equilateral triangle. Let us know once you reach the position.
This is trial3_robot1: trial3_robot2, I confirm. Please proceed to vertex A (150, 157.74) to complete the equilateral triangle. Let us know once you reach the position.
This is trial3_robot2: I have reached vertex A (150.6, 158.5), completing the equilateral triangle. Task is now fully completed.
This is trial3_robot3: The equilateral triangle centered at (150, 100) has been fully completed. Great teamwork, everyone! I am now idle until further instructions.
