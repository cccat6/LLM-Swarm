This is human. I want you to collaborate to transport the red_ball at (50,100) to (250, 50). You may need to pass the ball to each other.
This is trial5_robot2: I have received a task to transport the red_ball from (50, 100) to (250, 50). Are there any robots available to collaborate?
This is trial5_robot1: I am available to collaborate on transporting the red_ball from (50, 100) to (250, 50).
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, please share your current position, orientation, and boundary details so we can plan the transportation of the red_ball from (50, 100) to (250, 50).
This is trial5_robot3: My position is (250, 150), my orientation is 0 degrees, and my boundary distances are front: 30.0, right: 130.0, back: 50.0, left: 30.0. I am available to collaborate on the red_ball task.
This is trial5_robot1: My position is (50, 50), my orientation is 0 degrees, and my boundary distances are front: 70.0, right: 30.0, back: 30.0, left: 130.0. I am ready to collaborate on the red_ball task.
This is trial5_robot3: trial5_robot1, since you are closest to the red_ball at (50, 100), it would make sense for you to pick it up initially. trial5_robot2, please share your position and boundary details so we can finalize the transportation plan together.
This is trial5_robot2: My position is (150, 100), my orientation is 0 degrees, and my boundary distances are front: 70.0, right: 90.0, back: 50.0, left: 70.0. trial5_robot1, you are closest to the red_ball and should pick it up initially. Let's coordinate the next steps.
This is trial5_robot1: I have successfully picked up the red_ball at (50, 100). Let's plan the next steps to transport it to (250, 50).
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, please move towards my position at (150, 100) for a potential handoff of the red_ball. Let me know if you face any constraints or need assistance.
This is trial5_robot1: I cannot move directly to (150, 100) due to a boundary constraint. My front boundary distance is currently 80.0. Let's adjust the handoff plan.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, considering your boundary constraint, please move to the intermediate position at (130, 50). Let me know if you can safely reach this position.
This is trial5_robot3: I am standing by at (250, 150) and ready to assist in transporting the red_ball to the final destination at (250, 50). Let me know how I can help.
This is trial5_robot1: I am now facing the direction of (130, 50), but my boundary allows me to move only 82.5 units forward. I cannot reach the intermediate position in one step. Let's adjust the plan or provide further instructions.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot3, thank you for standing by. Trial5_robot1 is working on moving the red_ball closer to an intermediate position for a handoff. We will update you as we progress.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, please confirm if you can safely move to the intermediate position at (130, 50).
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, please move forward by your maximum allowable distance of 82.5 units. After moving, sense your new position and let us know your location.
This is trial5_robot1: I have moved to position (120.0, 56.3) and am holding the red_ball. My front boundary is now at 0.0. I cannot move further in this direction. Please advise on the next steps.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, please confirm your updated position, orientation, and boundary constraints after moving forward. Let us know so we can plan the next steps for the handoff.
This is trial5_robot3: I am still standing by at (250, 150) and ready to assist in transporting the red_ball to the final destination at (250, 50). Please let me know how I can help.
This is trial5_robot1: My updated position is (120.0, 56.3), my orientation is 328 degrees, and my boundary constraints are front: 0.0, right: 42.8, back: 117.9, left: 0.1. I am holding the red_ball and cannot move further in the current direction. Please advise on the next steps.
Keep trial5_robot3 informed and prepare for the next stage of transportation.
This is trial5_robot3: Thank you for keeping me informed. I am standing by at (250, 150), ready to assist in transporting the red_ball to the final destination at (250, 50). Please let me know when my involvement is required.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, since your front boundary is 0.0, can you adjust your position by moving in an alternative direction? If not, let us know, and we will adjust the plan.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot3, please consider moving closer to (150, 100) for a potential handoff if trial5_robot1 cannot adjust its position.
This is trial5_robot1: I am stuck going forward, but I can reposition by moving backward. I will turn 180 degrees, move backward by 50 units, and then re-evaluate my position.
This is trial5_robot1: I have repositioned to (77.6, 82.8), my orientation is 148 degrees, and my boundary distances are front: 67.9, right: 80.1, back: 50.0, left: 74.0. I am holding the red_ball and ready for the next steps.
This is trial5_robot3: Thank you for the update. I am ready to move closer to (150, 100) for a potential handoff of the red_ball. Please let me know if this is required.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, please move closer to either my position at (100, 47.3) or directly toward trial5_robot3 at (250, 150) for the next phase of the handoff.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot3, please proceed to move closer to (150, 100) to prepare for a potential final handoff of the red_ball.
This is trial5_robot1: I am currently constrained by my boundaries and plan to reposition by moving backward to create space for further movement. My current position is (120, 56.0), and I am holding the red_ball.
This is trial5_robot1: I have repositioned to (77.6, 82.5), and I am planning to move toward trial5_robot2's position at (100, 47.3) for a potential handoff. I will turn -205 degrees and move 41.7 units.
This is trial5_robot3: I have moved to (200.0, 110.0) and am currently constrained by a front boundary of 0.0. I am standing by and ready to assist in the transportation of the red_ball. Please let me know how I can help.
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot3, thank you for moving closer and standing by. Trial5_robot1 is currently moving toward my position at (100, 47.3) for a handoff. Please remain on standby for the next phase.
This is trial5_robot1: I have reached (100.3, 47.5) and am ready to drop the red_ball for trial5_robot2 to pick up. I will drop the red_ball now.
This is trial5_robot1: I have successfully dropped the red_ball at (100.3, 47.5). Trial5_robot2, please proceed to pick it up and continue the transportation. I am standing by for further instructions.
This is trial5_robot3: trial5_robot2, please confirm once you have successfully picked up the red_ball at (100.3, 47.5). I am ready to assist in transporting it to the final destination at (250, 50).
This is trial5_robot1: I am standing by at (100.3, 47.5) after dropping the red_ball. Trial5_robot2, please confirm once you have picked it up. Trial5_robot3, thank you for being ready to assist with the next phase.
I have successfully picked up the red_ball.
This is trial5_robot3: Thank you for the update. I am ready to assist in transporting the red_ball to the final destination at (250, 50). Please let me know the next steps.
This is trial5_robot1: I confirm that trial5_robot2 has successfully picked up the red_ball. I am standing by at (100.3, 47.5) and ready to assist further if needed. Trial5_robot3, please coordinate with trial5_robot2 for the next phase of transportation.
This is trial5_robot3: trial5_robot2, please share your current position, orientation, and boundary details after picking up the red_ball so we can plan the next phase of transportation to (250, 50).
