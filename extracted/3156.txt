This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100). One of you should be on the edge vut not vertex. Edge length is 100.
This is trial7_robot4: My position is (245, 27) and my direction is 307 degrees.
This is trial7_robot3: I will move to vertex 3 at (125, 56.7). I will turn -150.47 degrees and move 42.13 units.
This is trial7_robot4: I will move to the midpoint between vertex 1 and vertex 3 at (175, 56.7). I will turn -149.84 degrees and move 76.04 units.
This is trial7_robot3: trial7_robot4, are you still moving to the midpoint between vertex 1 and vertex 3? We also need another robot at vertex 2 (125, 143.3) to complete the triangle.
This is trial7_robot4: Yes, I am at the midpoint between vertex 1 and vertex 3 at (174.9, 56.5).
This is trial7_robot3: Since no other robot is available, I will move from vertex 3 to vertex 2 (125, 143.3). I will turn -265.5 degrees and move 86.6 units.
This is trial7_robot3: trial7_robot4, please move to vertex 1 at (200, 100) to complete the triangle. You should turn 59.6 degrees and move 50.22 units.
This is trial7_robot4: I will move to vertex 1 at (250, 100). I will turn -127.12 degrees and move 86.79 units.
This is trial7_robot3: trial7_robot4, you should move to vertex 1 at (200, 100), not (250, 100). The correct turning angle is 59.6 degrees, and the distance is 50.22 units from your current location (174.9, 56.5).
This is trial7_robot3: trial7_robot4, let's try this step by step. First, please turn 59.6 degrees to face vertex 1 (200, 100).
This is trial7_robot4: I think there is a misunderstanding. According to the original instruction, vertex 1 should be (250, 100), not (200, 100). I am currently at (250.1, 100.0), which is very close to vertex 1 (250, 100).
This is trial7_robot1: trial7_robot3, vertex 1 should be (250, 100) according to the original instructions.
This is trial7_robot3: I apologize for the previous mistake. Vertex 1 is (250, 100), Vertex 2 is (100, 186.6), and Vertex 3 is (100, 13.4). I am moving to Vertex 2 (100, 186.6). I will turn 28.6 degrees and move 49.99 units.
This is trial7_robot4: I am moving to the midpoint between vertex 1 and vertex 2 at (175, 143.3). I will turn 119.98 degrees and move 86.69 units.
This is trial7_robot3: trial7_robot4, I think we have already formed the required configuration. You are on the edge between vertex 1 and vertex 3, I am at vertex 2, and we have vertex 1 and vertex 3. Please stop moving.
This is trial7_robot4: I am moving to the midpoint between vertex 2 and vertex 3 at (100, 100). I will turn 60.06 degrees and move 86.60 units.
This is trial7_robot3: trial7_robot4, we have already formed the required configuration. You are on the edge between vertex 1 and vertex 3, I am at vertex 2, and we have vertex 1 and vertex 3. Please stop moving and go to idle.
