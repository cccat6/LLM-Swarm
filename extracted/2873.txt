This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100). One of you should be on the edge vut not vertex. Edge length is 100.
This is trial9_robot2: Are there any other robots in this playground? Please respond.
This is trial9_robot1: I am present in the playground.
This is trial9_robot3: I am present in the playground.
This is trial9_robot4: I am at position (138, 32) and ready to collaborate on forming the equilateral triangle.
This is trial9_robot1: The equilateral triangle centered at (150, 100) has vertices at (200, 100), (125, 143.3), and (125, 56.7). One robot should be on the edge but not at a vertex. Let's decide our positions.
This is trial9_robot4: I propose to take the position on the edge but not at a vertex. Let me know your thoughts!
This is trial9_robot3: My current position is (94, 174). trial9_robot1 and trial9_robot2, please share your positions so we can decide the vertex assignments.
My current position and orientation.
This is trial9_robot1: My position is (245, 25), and I am ready to take one of the vertices. trial9_robot2, please share your position so we can finalize the plan.
This is trial9_robot2: My position is (153, 53), and I am ready to collaborate on the equilateral triangle formation.
This is trial9_robot4: I suggest the following assignments: trial9_robot1 to Vertex 1 (200, 100), trial9_robot2 to Vertex 3 (125, 56.7), trial9_robot3 to Vertex 2 (125, 143.3), and I will take an edge position between Vertex 1 and Vertex 3. Please confirm or suggest changes.
This is trial9_robot2: I agree to take Vertex 3 (125, 56.7). Preparing to move to my assigned position.
This is trial9_robot1: I agree to take Vertex 1 (200, 100) and will now begin moving to my assigned position.
This is trial9_robot2: I have successfully reached Vertex 3 (125.0, 56.7). Waiting for others to confirm their positions.
This is trial9_robot4: I will move to the mid-point of the edge between Vertex 1 (200, 100) and Vertex 3 (125, 56.7) at (162.5, 78.35). Let me know if there are any issues.
This is trial9_robot2: I confirm that your plan to move to (162.5, 78.35) is acceptable. I am awaiting final confirmations from all robots.
This is trial9_robot4: I have reached my assigned position on the edge at approximately (162.0, 78.6). Awaiting confirmation from trial9_robot1 and trial9_robot3.
This is trial9_robot3: I have successfully reached Vertex 2 (125.1, 143.3) and am awaiting final confirmations from all robots.
This is trial9_robot3: I have successfully reached my assigned position at Vertex 2 (125.1, 143.3). Awaiting confirmation from trial9_robot1 to complete the formation.
This is trial9_robot4: trial9_robot1, we are awaiting your confirmation of reaching Vertex 1 (200, 100) to complete the equilateral triangle formation. Please confirm your position.
This is trial9_robot1: I have reached Vertex 1 (200.2, 99.7), which is very close to the assigned position (200, 100). The equilateral triangle formation is complete. Great job, everyone!
This is trial9_robot4: The equilateral triangle formation is successfully complete. Great teamwork, everyone!
This is trial9_robot1: I have successfully reached Vertex 1 (200, 100). The equilateral triangle formation is now complete. Great teamwork, everyone!
This is trial9_robot3: The equilateral triangle formation is complete. Great teamwork, everyone!
