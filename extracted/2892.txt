This is human. I want you all form a circle with the center (150, 100) with radius 50 uniformly.
This is trial3_robot4: All robots, please respond with your names if you are active in the playground.
This is trial3_robot5: I am active in the playground.
This is trial3_robot3: I am active in the playground.
This is trial3_robot6: I am active in the playground.
This is trial3_robot4: We are forming a circle with center (150, 100) and radius 50. The positions are as follows: trial3_robot4 -> (200, 100), trial3_robot5 -> (150, 150), trial3_robot3 -> (100, 100), trial3_robot6 -> (150, 50). Please confirm your assignment and start moving to your positions.
This is trial3_robot5: I confirm my position assignment as (150, 150) and will move there now.
This is trial3_robot6: I confirm my position assignment as (150, 50) and will move there now.
This is trial3_robot2: I am active in the playground. Please assign my position for the circle formation.
This is trial3_robot3: I confirm my position assignment as (100, 100) and will move there now.
This is trial3_robot1: I am active in the playground. Please assign my position for the circle formation.
This is trial3_robot4: The updated positions for the circle with center (150, 100) and radius 50 are as follows: trial3_robot4 -> (200, 100), trial3_robot5 -> (175, 143.3), trial3_robot3 -> (125, 143.3), trial3_robot6 -> (100, 100), trial3_robot2 -> (125, 56.7), trial3_robot1 -> (175, 56.7). Please confirm your assignment and move to your positions.
This is trial3_robot3: I have reached my assigned position at (100, 100).
This is trial3_robot1: I confirm my position assignment as (175, 56.7) and will move there now.
This is trial3_robot3: I confirm my updated position assignment as (125, 143.3) and will move there now.
This is trial3_robot5: I confirm my updated position assignment as (175, 143.3) and will move there now.
This is trial3_robot6: I confirm my updated position assignment as (100, 100) and will move there now.
This is trial3_robot3: I have reached my updated position at (125, 143.3).
This is trial3_robot3: I have reached my updated position at (125, 143.3).
