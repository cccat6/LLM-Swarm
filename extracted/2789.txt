This is human. I want you all align to a line with same y-value.
This is trial6_robot3: My current y-coordinate is 171. Let's align to a common y-value.
This is trial6_robot4: My current position is (200, 150). Let's collaborate to decide the target y-coordinate for alignment.
This is trial6_robot4: My current y-coordinate is 150. I suggest we align to y = 160. Please confirm.
This is trial6_robot3: I confirm the suggestion to align to y = 160. Moving now.
This is trial6_robot2: I have aligned to y = 160. My current position is (100, 160).
This is trial6_robot3: I am moving to align to y = 160. Turning and moving now.
This is trial6_robot1: I have aligned to y = 160. My current position is (92.4, 160.0).
This is trial6_robot3: I have aligned to y = 160 at position (150.0, 160.0). Have all robots aligned?
This is trial6_robot2: I have confirmed alignment to y = 160 at position (100.0, 160.0). Are all robots aligned now?
This is trial6_robot1: I confirm alignment to y = 160 at position (92.4, 160.0). Is the task completed now?
This is trial6_robot2: All robots have aligned to y = 160. The task is completed. Entering idle mode.
I have aligned to y = 160.
alignment to y = 160 confirmed
I am now aligned with y = 160.
