This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
This is trial1_robot1: Are there any other robots in the playground? Please respond with your name.
This is trial1_robot3: I am here in the playground.
This is trial1_robot2: I am here in the playground.
This is trial1_robot2: I am at (84, 41) and ready to collaborate on forming the triangle.
This is trial1_robot2: I propose the following plan: trial1_robot1 moves to (178.87, 100), I will move to (135.57, 125), and trial1_robot3 moves to (135.57, 75).
This is trial1_robot3: I agree with the plan. I will move to (135.57, 75).
This is trial1_robot1: I have successfully reached my assigned position at (178.87, 100).
This is trial1_robot2: I have successfully reached my assigned position at (135.5, 125.0).
This is trial1_robot2: trial1_robot3, have you reached your assigned position at (135.57, 75)? Please confirm.
This is trial1_robot3: I have successfully reached my assigned position at (135.57, 75).
This is trial1_robot2: The equilateral triangle formation with center at (150, 100) has been successfully achieved by all robots. Task complete.
This is trial1_robot1: The task of forming the equilateral triangle is complete. Great teamwork!
