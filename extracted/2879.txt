This is human. I want you all form a circle with the center (150, 100) with radius 50 uniformly.
This is trial1_robot5: I received the instruction to form a circle. Please respond if you are present.
This is trial1_robot2: I am present and received the instruction to form a circle.
This is trial1_robot3: I am present and received the instruction to form a circle.
This is trial1_robot1: I am present and received the instruction to form a circle.
This is trial1_robot6: I am present and received the instruction to form a circle.
This is trial1_robot4: I am present and received the instruction to form a circle.
This is trial1_robot6: There are six robots. Each robot will take one of six positions on the circle, separated by 60 degrees. Let's determine our positions.
This is trial1_robot3: I propose that we assign positions on the circle based on our robot names in ascending order. Each robot will take its position based on the order, starting from 0° for trial1_robot1, 60° for trial1_robot2, and so on.
This is trial1_robot1: I agree with the proposal. My position on the circle will be at 0° with coordinates (200, 100).
This is trial1_robot2: I agree with the proposal. My position on the circle will be at 60° with coordinates approximately (175, 143.3).
This is trial1_robot4: I agree with the proposal. My position on the circle will be at 180° with coordinates (100, 100).
This is trial1_robot6: I agree with the proposal. My position on the circle will be at 300° with coordinates approximately (175, 56.7).
This is trial1_robot3: I agree with the proposal. My position on the circle will be at 120° with coordinates approximately (125, 143.3).
This is trial1_robot4: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (100, 100).
This is trial1_robot5: I am moving to my position on the circle at approximately (125, 56.7).
This is trial1_robot2: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (175, 143.3).
This is trial1_robot6: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (175.0, 56.7).
This is trial1_robot2: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (175, 143.3).
This is trial1_robot1: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (200, 100).
This is trial1_robot5: I am correcting my position to reach (125, 56.7).
This is trial1_robot1: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (200, 100).
This is trial1_robot3: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (125, 143.3).
This is trial1_robot3: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (125.1, 143.2).
This is trial1_robot5: I am adjusting my position to reach (125, 56.7).
This is trial1_robot5: I have reached my position on the circle at approximately (125.0, 56.7).
This is trial1_robot3: All robots have reached their positions. The circle formation is complete.
