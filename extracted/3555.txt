This is human. I want you to collaborate to transport the red_ball at (50,100) to (250, 50). You may need to pass the ball to each other.
This is trial9_robot5: I am assigned to position (100, 100) on the circle.
This is trial9_robot5: I have reached my position on the circle at (100, 100).
This is trial9_robot6: I have reached my position on the circle at (200, 100).
This is trial9_robot6: Requesting trial9_robot3 and trial9_robot4 to confirm their positions on the circle.
This is trial9_robot1: I have picked up the red_ball at (50, 100). Ready to collaborate for transport.
This is trial9_robot5: Reminder to trial9_robot3 and trial9_robot4 to confirm your positions on the circle.
This is trial9_robot5: Reminder to trial9_robot3 and trial9_robot4. Your assigned positions on the circle are (200, 100) for trial9_robot3 and (150, 150) for trial9_robot4. Please confirm your status.
This is trial9_robot6: I am currently at (200, 100). If trial9_robot3 is also assigned here, I will adjust my position. Please clarify.
This is trial9_robot5: trial9_robot3 and trial9_robot4 have not confirmed their positions. The task is incomplete. Let’s discuss how to proceed.
This is trial9_robot3: I am currently at (250, 150), facing 0 degrees. I need clarification on my assigned position on the circle.
This is trial9_robot6: Since trial9_robot3 and trial9_robot4 have not confirmed, I suggest we redistribute our positions to cover the missing spots. For example, trial9_robot5 and I can adjust our positions to form a partial circle. Please share your thoughts.
This is trial9_robot5: The task of forming the circle is incomplete due to lack of response from trial9_robot3 and trial9_robot4. I am going idle.
This is trial9_robot2: I am at (150, 100) and ready to assist in redistributing positions to complete the circle formation. I suggest I move to (150, 150) to cover the missing spot. trial9_robot6, can you adjust your position to ensure coverage?
This is trial9_robot3: I am at (250, 150) and ready to assist. I suggest I move to (250, 100) to complete the circle formation. Please confirm if this is acceptable.
I have reached the assigned position at (150, 150) on the circle.
This is trial9_robot4: I have reached my assigned position on the circle at (150, 150).
This is trial9_robot5: trial9_robot6 is already at (200, 100). trial9_robot3, please confirm your status or adjust your position. Let’s finalize the circle formation.
This is trial9_robot5: Reminder to trial9_robot3 to confirm your position on the circle. Your assigned position is (200, 100).
This is trial9_robot3: Since trial9_robot6 is already at (200, 100), I will adjust my position to (250, 100) to complete the circle formation. Proceeding now.
This is trial9_robot4: trial9_robot6 is already at (200, 100). If trial9_robot3 does not respond, I suggest redistributing positions to ensure uniform formation of the circle.
This is trial9_robot4: Since trial9_robot3 has not responded, I suggest redistributing positions to complete the circle formation. Let’s discuss and finalize the plan.
