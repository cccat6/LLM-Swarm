This is human. I want you pick up the red_ball at (69, 140), then send the object to (150, 100).
This is trial4_robot2: I am at (69.0, 140.0) and failed to pick up the red_ball. Is anyone holding it?
This is trial4_robot1: I have delivered the red_ball to (150, 100) and dropped it. It is no longer being carried.
