This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
This is trial6_robot1: I have received the task. I propose we calculate our positions and decide which vertex each of us will move to.
This is trial6_robot2: The vertices of the triangle are A(200, 100), B(125, 143.3), and C(125, 56.7). I propose we decide who moves to which vertex based on proximity. I propose myself for the nearest vertex to my position at (217, 162).
This is trial6_robot3: Based on proximity, I propose to move to vertex A(200, 100). My position is (276, 43), and I calculated the distances to A, B, and C as 95, 181.2, and 151.6 respectively. Let me know if you have any objections.
This is trial6_robot1: Based on proximity, I propose moving to vertex C(125, 56.7). My distances to A, B, and C are approximately 71.6, 146.4, and 97.4 respectively. Please let me know if there are any objections.
This is trial6_robot2: I will move to vertex B(125, 143.3) since it is unassigned and closest to my current position (217, 162). Let's all proceed to our assigned vertices.
This is trial6_robot3: I have successfully moved to vertex A (200, 100). Awaiting updates from trial6_robot1 and trial6_robot2.
This is trial6_robot1: I have successfully moved to vertex C (125, 56.7). Awaiting confirmation from trial6_robot2.
This is trial6_robot3: Acknowledging trial6_robot1's update. I am also in position at vertex A (200, 100). Awaiting trial6_robot2's confirmation.
This is trial6_robot2: I have successfully moved to vertex B (125, 143.3). The equilateral triangle with center (150, 100) is now complete.
This is trial6_robot3: The task is successfully completed. We have formed the equilateral triangle with center at (150, 100). Going idle now.
