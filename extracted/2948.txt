This is human. I want you pick up the red_ball at (224, 85), then send the object to (150, 100).
This is trial5_robot1: I am at (224.5, 85.2) and unable to pick up the red_ball. Is anyone else carrying it or working on this task?
This is trial5_robot2: I have delivered the red_ball to the destination at (150, 100) and dropped it there.
