This is human. I want you all align to a line with same y-value.
This is trial3_robot3: My current y-value is 154. Please share your y-values so we can align.
This is trial3_robot2: My current y-value is 35.
This is trial3_robot2: My current position is (100, 35). What are your positions?
This is trial3_robot4: My current position is (200, 18) and my y-value is 18. Let's decide on a common y-value for alignment.
This is trial3_robot3: I propose we align to y = 35, as it minimizes movement for everyone. Please confirm.
This is trial3_robot4: I agree to align to y = 35. Please confirm so we can proceed.
This is trial3_robot3: I confirm the alignment target is y = 35. Let's proceed to align.
This is trial3_robot2: I am already aligned to y = 35 and ready.
This is trial3_robot3: I will turn -23 degrees to face South and move 119 units to align to y = 35.
This is trial3_robot4: I am aligned to y = 35 and ready. Please update me on your status.
This is trial3_robot2: I am already aligned to y = 35 and ready.
This is trial3_robot3: I am aligned to y = 35 and ready. All robots are aligned. Task complete.
This is trial3_robot3: I am aligned to y = 35. All robots are aligned. Task completed.
This is trial3_robot1: I am aligned to y = 35 and ready. Task complete.
