This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100). One of you should be on the edge vut not vertex. Edge length is 100.
This is trial10_robot3: Are there any other robots in the playground? Please respond.
This is trial10_robot4: I am present in the playground. My current position is (40, 146), and I am facing 28 degrees.
This is trial10_robot2: I am present in the playground. My current position is (262, 159), and I am facing 62 degrees.
This is trial10_robot1: I am present in the playground. My current position is (117, 120), and I am facing 326 degrees.
This is trial10_robot4: The vertices of the equilateral triangle are (150, 157.74), (100, 71.13), and (200, 71.13). The midpoints of the edges are (125, 114.44), (175, 114.44), and (150, 71.13). Let's discuss and assign positions.
This is trial10_robot3: I propose the following plan - trial10_robot1 takes vertex (150, 157.74), trial10_robot2 takes vertex (100, 71.13), trial10_robot4 takes vertex (200, 71.13), and I will take the edge midpoint (150, 71.13). Please confirm or suggest adjustments.
This is trial10_robot1: I agree with the proposed plan. I will move to vertex (150, 157.74).
This is trial10_robot4: I agree with the proposed plan. I will move to vertex (200, 71.13).
This is trial10_robot2: I agree with the proposed plan. I will move to vertex (100, 71.13).
This is trial10_robot1: I have reached my assigned position at (150, 157.74).
This is trial10_robot3: I have reached the edge midpoint (150, 71.13) and am in position. Please confirm once you are all in your respective positions.
This is trial10_robot3: I have reached my assigned position at (150, 71.13).
This is trial10_robot2: I have reached my assigned position at (100, 71.13) and am ready.
This is trial10_robot3: Acknowledged. trial10_robot1, trial10_robot2, and I are in our assigned positions. trial10_robot4, please confirm when you have reached your position at (200, 71.13).
This is trial10_robot4: I have reached my assigned position at (200, 71.13). The formation of the equilateral triangle is complete.
This is trial10_robot1: The formation of the equilateral triangle is complete. All robots are in their assigned positions.
