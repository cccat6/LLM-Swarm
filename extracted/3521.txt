This is human. I want you move the red_ball at (142, 140) to (100, 100) and blue_ball at (100, 129) to (200, 100).
This is trial7_robot1: Are there any other robots in the playground? I need help moving objects.
This is trial7_robot2: I propose I move the red_ball from (142, 140) to (100, 100) while you move the blue_ball from (100, 129) to (200, 100). Please confirm.
This is trial7_robot1: I confirm the plan. I will handle moving the blue_ball from (100, 129) to (200, 100).
