This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
This is trial5_robot1: Identifying myself. Any other robots here?
This is trial5_robot3: I am here.
This is trial5_robot1: trial5_robot3 is here. Any other robots here?
This is trial5_robot3: There are only two robots (trial5_robot1 and myself). We cannot form an equilateral triangle.
This is trial5_robot2: I am at (125.0, 143.3). I believe there are three robots. We can form an equilateral triangle with center (150, 100). trial5_robot1, can you go to (200, 100)? trial5_robot3, can you go to (125, 56.7)?
This is trial5_robot3: I have reached (125, 56.7).
This is trial5_robot2: trial5_robot1, are you there? I am at (125.0, 143.3), trial5_robot3 is at (125, 56.7). We are trying to form an equilateral triangle with center (150, 100). Your target is (200, 100). Do you need help?
This is trial5_robot1: I am having trouble reaching (200, 100). trial5_robot2 and trial5_robot3, can you please provide your boundary information?
boundary information
This is trial5_robot1: My position is (299.8, 134.5), my orientation is 135.0, and my distances to the boundary are front: 92.7, right: 0.3, back: 0.3, left: 190.1.
This is trial5_robot3: My distances to the boundary are front: 143.5, right: 175.0, back: 56.8, left: 125.3. My position is (125.2, 56.7), and my orientation is 87.1.
This is trial5_robot2: My position is (125.0, 143.3), my orientation is 208.4. My distances to the boundary are front: 142.1, right: 64.5, back: 119.2, left: 162.9.
This is trial5_robot3: trial5_robot1, try turning -90 degrees and then move forward. You seem to be stuck at the boundary.
This is trial5_robot1: I am at the boundary and cannot form an equilateral triangle. trial5_robot2 and trial5_robot3, can you form a line with the center at (150, 100)?
This is trial5_robot3: trial5_robot1, trial5_robot2, I don't think we can form a line with the center at (150, 100). trial5_robot2, can you verify this?
This is trial5_robot2: I am at (100.0, 100.0). After calculation, trial5_robot1, trial5_robot3 and I cannot form a line with the center at (150, 100) because the three points are not on the same line. trial5_robot1 is at the boundary. What should we do next?
This is trial5_robot3: Since trial5_robot1 is at the boundary, I suggest that we try to form an isosceles triangle instead of an equilateral triangle. What do you think, trial5_robot1 and trial5_robot2?
This is trial5_robot1: I am at the boundary and cannot move. trial5_robot2 and trial5_robot3, can you try moving the object to the center (150, 100)?
This is trial5_robot3: trial5_robot2, do you have the object? Can you move to the center (150, 100)?
This is trial5_robot2: I am at (100.0, 100.0) and I am not carrying the object. trial5_robot3, do you have the object? If you do, can you move to the center (150, 100)?
This is trial5_robot3: trial5_robot1, neither trial5_robot2 nor I have the object. We cannot sense the object, so we cannot move it to the center.
This is trial5_robot2: None of us (trial5_robot1, trial5_robot2, trial5_robot3) have the object, and we cannot sense it. We are unable to move the object to the center (150, 100). We need new instructions.
This is trial5_robot3: We are waiting for new instructions.
This is trial5_robot1: None of us have the object, and we cannot sense it. We are unable to move the object to the center (150, 100). We need new instructions.
