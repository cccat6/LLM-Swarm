This is human. I want you pick up the red_ball at (173, 174), then send the object to (150, 100).
This is trial9_robot2: I am at (173.0, 173.9) but unable to pick up the red_ball. Can anyone clarify if the red_ball is at this location or provide assistance?
This is trial9_robot1: The red_ball has already been picked up from (173, 174) and delivered to the target location (150, 100). Please check the new location.
