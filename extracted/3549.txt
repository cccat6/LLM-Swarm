This is human. I want you to collaborate to transport the red_ball at (50,100) to (250, 50). You may need to pass the ball to each other.
This is trial7_robot2: Is there any other robot in the playground? We need to collaborate to transport the red_ball.
This is trial7_robot3: I am here. Let's collaborate to transport the red_ball.
This is trial7_robot2: My position is (150, 100), and I cannot reach the red_ball at (50, 100) due to boundary constraints. Please let me know your position and suggest a plan.
This is trial7_robot1: I have picked up the red_ball at (50, 100). I cannot move directly to (250, 50) due to boundary constraints. Can one of you assist in transporting the ball further?
This is trial7_robot3: My current position is (200, 20). I will move toward trial7_robot1 to assist in transporting the red_ball.
This is trial7_robot1: I am at (50.0, 100.0) and holding the red_ball. I cannot reach the destination (250, 50) directly due to boundary constraints. I suggest passing the ball to another robot closer to the destination. Please share your positions and boundary constraints so we can plan the handoff.
This is trial7_robot3: My current position is (200, 20). I am moving toward you to assist in the handoff. My boundary constraints are: front 0 units, back 160 units, left 80 units, right 0 units.
This is trial7_robot3: My current position is (280, 20), and I cannot move further North or East due to boundary constraints. I suggest trial7_robot2 or trial7_robot1 move closer to my position for the handoff.
This is trial7_robot3: My current position is (280, 100), and I am facing East. My boundary constraints are: front 80 units, back 80 units, left 80 units, right 0 units. I suggest trial7_robot1 or trial7_robot2 move closer to me for the handoff.
This is trial7_robot3: My current position is (280, 100), and I am facing East. My boundary constraints are: front 80 units, back 80 units, left 80 units, right 0 units. I suggest trial7_robot1 or trial7_robot2 move closer to me for the handoff.
This is trial7_robot3: My current position is (280, 100), and I am facing East. My boundary constraints are: front 80 units, back 80 units, left 80 units, right 0 units. I suggest trial7_robot1 or trial7_robot2 move closer to me for the handoff.
This is trial7_robot1: I suggest we meet at (120, 100) for the handoff. I will move there now.
