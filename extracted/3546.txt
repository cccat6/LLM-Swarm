This is human. I want you to collaborate to transport the red_ball at (50,100) to (250, 50). You may need to pass the ball to each other.
This is trial6_robot2: I received a task to transport the red_ball from (50, 100) to (250, 50). Are there any other robots available to collaborate?
Confirming position at (100, 100)
My target position is now (125, 56.7). I will plan my movement to reach this position.
This is trial6_robot5: I have reached my target position at (124.9, 56.7) and am ready for further instructions.
This is trial6_robot3: I am at (250, 50) and ready to receive the red_ball.
This is trial6_robot4: I have reached my target position at (100, 100) and am ready for further instructions.
This is trial6_robot2: trial6_robot4, since you are at (100, 100), would you retrieve the red_ball at (50, 100) and coordinate with trial6_robot3 at (250, 50) to complete the task?
This is trial6_robot5: Requesting all robots to confirm their positions on the circle to ensure uniform formation.
This is trial6_robot4: Confirming my position at (100, 100). I am in place for the uniform circle formation.
This is trial6_robot5: Reminder to trial6_robot1 and trial6_robot2 to confirm your positions on the circle for uniform formation.
This is trial6_robot5: Only 4 robots (trial6_robot4, trial6_robot5, trial6_robot6, and possibly others) have confirmed their positions. The circle formation cannot be completed with the current number of robots. Awaiting further instructions.
