This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
identify other robots in the environment
This is trial9_robot3: If there are other robots in the environment, please respond with your name and current position.
This is trial9_robot2: I am present. My position is (223, 123).
This is trial9_robot1: I am present. My position is (168, 169).
This is trial9_robot2: We need to decide on the side length of the equilateral triangle. I suggest a default side length of 200 units unless otherwise specified.
This is trial9_robot1: I will move to Vertex 2 at approximately (92.27, 199.9).
This is trial9_robot2: I will move to Vertex 3 at approximately (92.27, 0.1).
This is trial9_robot3: I will move to Vertex 1 at approximately (265.47, 100).
This is trial9_robot1: I have reached Vertex 2 at approximately (92.0, 199.0).
This is trial9_robot1: Have you reached your assigned vertices? Please confirm your status.
This is trial9_robot1: There has been no confirmation of your positions. Please respond with your status or confirm your vertex positions.
This is trial9_robot2: I have reached Vertex 3 at approximately (94.4, 0).
This is trial9_robot2: I have reached my assigned vertex at approximately (94.4, 0).
This is trial9_robot3: My current position is (237, 149). I am heading to Vertex 1 at approximately (265.47, 100). Turning and moving now.
This is trial9_robot2: I am at Vertex 3 (94.4, 0). Waiting for trial9_robot3 to confirm reaching Vertex 1.
This is trial9_robot3: My current position is (224.6, 93.7). I am correcting my movement to reach Vertex 1 at approximately (265.47, 100.)
This is trial9_robot3: I have reached Vertex 1 at approximately (265.5, 100.0). The equilateral triangle formation is complete.
This is trial9_robot2: The equilateral triangle formation is complete. Great teamwork, everyone!
