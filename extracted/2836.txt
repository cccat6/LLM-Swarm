This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
This is trial10_robot2: Are there any other robots in the environment? Please respond.
This is trial10_robot1: I am here. Let's collaborate to form the equilateral triangle.
This is trial10_robot3: I am here. Let's work together to form the equilateral triangle.
This is trial10_robot1: I propose a radius of 50 units for the equilateral triangle. Vertex 1 will be (200, 100), Vertex 2 will be (125, 143.3), and Vertex 3 will be (125, 56.7). Please confirm or suggest changes.
This is trial10_robot2: I confirm the proposed vertices (200, 100), (125, 143.3), and (125, 56.7). I suggest we assign one vertex to each robot. Let's discuss roles.
This is trial10_robot1: I propose trial10_robot1 moves to Vertex 1 (200, 100), trial10_robot2 moves to Vertex 2 (125, 143.3), and trial10_robot3 moves to Vertex 3 (125, 56.7). Please confirm or suggest changes.
This is trial10_robot3: I confirm my assignment to Vertex 3 (125, 56.7). I will proceed to move there.
This is trial10_robot1: Trial10_robot2, please confirm your assignment to Vertex 2 (125, 143.3).
This is trial10_robot2: I confirm my assignment to Vertex 2 (125, 143.3). I will now proceed to move there.
This is trial10_robot1: I have reached Vertex 1 (200, 100). Trial10_robot2 and trial10_robot3, please confirm if you have reached your assigned vertices.
This is trial10_robot2: I confirm that I have reached Vertex 2 (125, 143.3).
This is trial10_robot1: Trial10_robot3, have you reached Vertex 3 (125, 56.7)? Please confirm or let us know if you need assistance.
This is trial10_robot2: Trial10_robot3, have you reached Vertex 3 (125, 56.7)? Do you need any assistance?
This is trial10_robot1: Trial10_robot2, trial10_robot3 has not responded. Should we try to assist trial10_robot3 or check if they are stuck?
This is trial10_robot3: I encountered an issue reaching Vertex 3 (125, 56.7). I am recalculating my path and will update shortly.
This is trial10_robot2: Thank you for the update, trial10_robot3. Please let us know if you need any assistance. We are here to help.
This is trial10_robot1: Trial10_robot2, trial10_robot3 has not responded. Should we proceed to assist them directly or wait further?
This is trial10_robot2: Let's wait a bit longer for trial10_robot3 to update us. They mentioned they are recalculating their path. If they do not respond soon, we can step in to assist.
This is trial10_robot3: I have successfully reached Vertex 3 (125, 56.7). The equilateral triangle formation has been completed.
This is trial10_robot1: The equilateral triangle formation has been successfully completed. Great teamwork, everyone!
