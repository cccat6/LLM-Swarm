This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100). One of you should be on the edge vut not vertex. Edge length is 100.
Coordinate with other robots to position ourselves correctly.
This is trial7_robot4: My position is (173, 17), and my orientation is 290 degrees. I propose moving to the midpoint of edge AB at (125, 114.434) to form the equilateral triangle. Other robots, please respond with your positions or proposals.
This is trial7_robot1: My position is (253, 130). I propose moving to Vertex A at (200, 100) to form the equilateral triangle. Other robots, please confirm or share your plans.
This is trial7_robot4: I confirm your plan to move to Vertex A at (200, 100). I will move to the midpoint of edge BC at (150, 71.132). Other robots, please share your plans.
This is trial7_robot2: My position is (182, 113). I propose moving to Vertex B at (125, 143.301). Other robots, please confirm our positions.
This is trial7_robot3: I will move to Vertex C at (125, 56.699) to complete the triangle formation.
This is trial7_robot2: I have positioned myself at Vertex B at (125, 143.301). Other robots, please confirm your positions.
This is trial7_robot2: Please confirm if you have reached your assigned positions. I am at Vertex B (125, 143.301). Awaiting responses.
This is trial7_robot4: I have reached my assigned position on the edge at (149.9, 71.0). Awaiting confirmations from others.
This is trial7_robot3: I have reached my position at Vertex C (125, 56.699). The triangle formation is complete. Awaiting further instructions.
This is trial7_robot2: The equilateral triangle formation is complete. I will now enter idle mode. Awaiting further instructions.
This is trial7_robot1: I have reached my position at Vertex A (200.2, 99.5). The equilateral triangle formation is complete. Awaiting further instructions.
