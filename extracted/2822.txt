This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
This is trial5_robot2: Is there anyone else in the playground? Please respond.
This is trial5_robot1: I am here and ready to collaborate. Let's form the equilateral triangle.
This is trial5_robot1: The vertices of the equilateral triangle are (150, 157.74), (100, 71.13), and (200, 71.13). I am currently at (21, 188). Let's decide who will take which vertex.
This is trial5_robot3: I will move to the vertex (100, 71.13). Please confirm or let me know if anyone else is planning to move there.
This is trial5_robot1: Confirming your move to (100, 71.13), trial5_robot3. I will move to the vertex (150, 157.74). Please let me know if there are any concerns.
This is trial5_robot2: I will move to the vertex (200, 71.13). Let me know if there are any concerns.
This is trial5_robot1: I confirm the plan. trial5_robot3 to (100, 71.13), trial5_robot2 to (200, 71.13), and I will move to (150, 157.74.)
This is trial5_robot3: I have reached the vertex (100, 71.13). Waiting for others to confirm their positions.
This is trial5_robot2: I have reached the vertex (200, 71.13). Waiting for trial5_robot1 to confirm their position.
This is trial5_robot3: I have reached the vertex (100, 71.13) and am waiting for the others to complete their moves.
This is trial5_robot3: Acknowledged. I am waiting for trial5_robot1 to confirm reaching (150, 157.74).
This is trial5_robot1: I have reached the vertex (150, 157.74). The equilateral triangle has been successfully formed. Great job, everyone!
This is trial5_robot1: I have reached the vertex (150, 157.7), which is close enough to the target (150, 157.74). The equilateral triangle formation is complete. Great teamwork, everyone!
This is trial5_robot2: Acknowledging that the equilateral triangle has been successfully formed. Great teamwork, everyone!
