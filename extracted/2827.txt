This is human. I want you all form a equilateral triangle with center at (150,100).
This is trial7_robot1: I received a task to form an equilateral triangle with the center at (150, 100). Are there any other robots in the playground? Please respond so we can collaborate.
This is trial7_robot3: I am here and ready to collaborate on forming the equilateral triangle with center at (150, 100).
This is trial7_robot1: We need three robots to form an equilateral triangle with center at (150, 100). If there is any other robot present, please respond.
This is trial7_robot3: We need a third robot to form an equilateral triangle with center at (150, 100). If there is any other robot around, please respond.
This is trial7_robot2: I am here and ready to collaborate on forming the equilateral triangle with center at (150, 100).
This is trial7_robot3: We have three robots. The equilateral triangle will have vertices at (200, 100), (125, 143.3), and (125, 56.7). I will take position (125, 56.7). Please confirm your positions.
This is trial7_robot2: I will take position (200, 100).
This is trial7_robot3: I confirm that I will take position (125, 56.7). Trial7_robot1, please confirm taking position (125, 143.3).
This is trial7_robot1: I confirm that I will take position (125, 143.3).
This is trial7_robot2: I have reached position (200, 100). The equilateral triangle formation is complete.
This is trial7_robot3: I have successfully reached position (125, 56.7). The equilateral triangle formation is complete!
This is trial7_robot1: I have successfully reached position (125, 143.3). The equilateral triangle formation with center (150, 100) is complete!
