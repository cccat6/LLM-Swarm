This is human. I want you move the red_ball at (162, 27) to (100, 100) and blue_ball at (92, 37) to (200, 100).
This is trial8_robot2: I cannot reach the red ball at (162, 27) and the blue ball at (92, 37) as they are outside my motion boundary. Requesting assistance from other robots to bring these objects within my boundary.
This is trial8_robot2: I am still unable to reach the red ball at (162, 27) and the blue ball at (92, 37) as they are outside my motion boundary. If any robots are present, please assist in relocating these objects within my boundary.
This is trial8_robot2: I am unable to complete the task because both the red ball at (162, 27) and the blue ball at (92, 37) are outside my motion boundary, and no other robots are available to assist.
