This is human. I want you to collaborate to transport the red_ball at (50,100) to (250, 50). You may need to pass the ball to each other.
This is trial3_robot2: Is anyone here to collaborate on transporting the red_ball?
This is trial3_robot2: Great! Let’s collaborate on transporting the red_ball from (50, 100) to (250, 50). What is your name and current position?
This is trial3_robot3: My current position is (250, 150). I am moving toward the red_ball at (50, 100).
This is trial3_robot1: My current position is (50, 50). I am moving toward the red_ball at (50, 100).
This is trial3_robot3: I have picked up the red_ball at (50, 100). Let’s coordinate the next steps.
This is trial3_robot3: I failed to pick up the red_ball. Has either of you picked it up?
trial3_robot1 and trial3_robot2 to confirm if either of them has picked it up.
This is trial3_robot1: I am at (50, 100) but have not picked up the red_ball. I will attempt to pick it up now.
