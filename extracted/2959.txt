This is human. I want you move the red_ball at (50, 180) to (100, 100) and blue_ball at (100, 183) to (200, 100).
This is trial1_robot2: Are there any other robots in the playground? Please respond if you are available to collaborate.
This is trial1_robot1: I am available and ready to collaborate.
This is trial1_robot2: Hello trial1_robot1, we need to move the red_ball from (50, 180) to (100, 100) and the blue_ball from (100, 183) to (200, 100). I propose that I handle the red_ball and you handle the blue_ball. Please confirm.
This is trial1_robot1: I have already picked up the red_ball and will move it to (100, 100). Please handle the blue_ball from (100, 183) to (200, 100).
This is trial1_robot2: I am moving to pick up the blue_ball from (100, 183). My current position is (250, 150), and I will adjust my orientation and move to its location.
This is trial1_robot2: I have recalculated my movement to the blue_ball at (100, 183). I will turn and move to the correct position now.
This is trial1_robot2: I am stuck at (300, 138.9) and unable to reach the blue_ball due to boundary constraints. Can you assist in moving the blue_ball from (100, 183) to (200, 100)?
This is trial1_robot2: I am still unable to reach the blue_ball at (100, 183). Trial1_robot1, please confirm if you can assist in moving the blue_ball to (200, 100).
This is trial1_robot1: I am currently dropping the red_ball at (100, 100). I will proceed to assist with the blue_ball shortly.
This is trial1_robot2: Trial1_robot1, can you please update me on your progress with the blue_ball? I am still unable to reach it due to my boundary constraints.
This is trial1_robot1: I am moving toward the blue_ball at (100, 183). Please wait for my update.
This is trial1_robot2: Trial1_robot1, can you please update me on your progress with the blue_ball? Let me know if you encountered any issues or need assistance.
This is trial1_robot1: I am currently at (200, 183.1) with the blue_ball. I am moving it to (200, 100) now.
This is trial1_robot1: Both tasks are complete. The red_ball is at (100, 100), and the blue_ball is at (200, 100). Please confirm if there is any further work.
